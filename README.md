This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Arkania
* The Arkanians are a well-ambitioned and aristocratic civilization, their imperial needs go far, and their influence touches all. But they do not pride themselves in conquest, keeping such matters in reserve, so as to pave way for a seen cultural superiority and strata that they percieve of their society.

  * Unique Unit: Delitor
  >A product of Arkanian innovation, the Delitor is a torsion artillery engine. Much of their efficiency comes from being able to tackle both infantry units and defensive fortifications with ease, as long as the construct is kept in a safe distance of course.
  
  * Unique Improvement: Statue of Glory
  >A physical manifestation of the Arkanian personality, the Statue of Glory is a significant piece of culture-work for any imperial city, carved on it a figure of either great historical renown from Arkanian prehistory, or a contemporary war hero/great person of the time; adequately giving the urge for the citizens of any city to strive to better themselves and their nation.

### Valkyrion
* The Valkyrmen of Valkyrion are stout, hardy and sturdy. Their homeland has bred them to be tough and strong, as resources are sparse, their peoples have been known to take bounty from either each other, or to the four corners of the world. Tales of their menacing strength and their barbaric brutality is widespread and backed with sufficing merit.

  * Unique Unit: Raidbearer
  >Raidbearers are the masters of their environment, particularly so in the coasts, where a majority of these people are pulled from. They utilize their environment, their senses and their forged instinct of survival to persevere and march through even the harshest of conditions. Their endurance is greatly increased as a result, resulting in a much more efficient and longer-lasting scouting range. Perfect, for calling and spotting for raids.
  
  * Unique Unit: Valkyr
  >The Valkyr are known to be more than a man, being wolves and bears rolled into one, beefy, hardened individual. Their Valkaxes can cut through many foes, and with the administration of their bloodred rage and frenzy, they can outlast most if not all other warriors in combat given time and attrition. Their wanton amounts of brutality is no joking matter either.

### Norland
* Not all shared the ideas of imperiality or plunder, the Norlanders have forged their destiny to be freedmen and liberators, upholders of liberty and democracy. Although their love of peace should not be mistaken as Norland is no rollover to imperialists or conquerors, willing to die for their homes rather than flee or be oppressed under foreign boots.

  * Unique Unit: Pioneer
  >The idea of freedom and liberty gave way inevitably to citizens thinking of forging their very own futures and destinies in the outlands and terra incognita of the world. Sanctioned by the government and given incentives, these Pioneers are the frontliners to expanding the reach of Norland, and bringing the ideas of democracy and enlightenment to even the most barren wastelands.
  
  * Unique Building: Parliamentary
  >The maintenance and upkeep of this libertarian form of government is not easily achieved by a noble palace or an imperial retinue. The Parliamentary is a body of government where judicial and legislative matters are handled, and local democracy is upkept through studious study and conduct. The Norlanders can rest well knowing their rights and freedoms are being protected by such social engineering.
  
### Svartur
* It is often a common mistake that the Svarturs praise death and denounces life as said in hushed tones or religious fervours. The Svarturians only appraises death as a complete and integrated part of life and society at large, whereas others dread it, the Order embraces and prepares for such occurences, leading to a strange neo-nihilist culture to form as their societal base.

  * Unique Unit: Cultist
  >The Cultists of the Svartur and their religion carries out a variety of tasks, defying most if not all medieval social stratas as these people both take up agricultural/peasantywork as well as filling in vital military ones. While maintaing a monastic hierarchy. This often produces a versatile workforce, capable of domestic works and the defense of the Svarturian people.
 
  * Unique Building: Graveyard
  > Unlike conventional graveyards, the Svarturian burial grounds are alight with festivities, commercial centers and oddly enough, habitation. The dead is commonly welcomed and seen as a positive cultural influence on the Order and it's followers. Where other civilizations find anguish and sadness, the Svartur find joy, merriness and in a sense, a rebirth of those long gone.
